## COVID-19 Tracker

This is a React frontend application to track COVID-19. Users can select a particular country to view the statistics on COVID-19 in the country.

This application is only a Dashboard to a API which I found on GitHub. Material-UI is used as the css framework of the application.

**How to Run the application.**

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />

You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />

See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />

Your app is ready to be deployed!
